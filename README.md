# CostOptimization
Optimizing AWS Storage Costs By Automating Stale EBS Snapshot Cleanup
Managing Elastic Block Store (EBS) snapshots effectively can be a challenge, especially as unused snapshots accumulate over time. These stale snapshots, which are no longer associated with active EC2 instances, can unnecessarily inflate storage costs.
In this post, I'll walk you through an automated solution using AWS Lambda to identify and delete stale EBS snapshots, helping you keep your AWS environment lean and cost-efficient.

# The Challenge: Stale Snapshots
EBS snapshots are incremental backups stored in S3. While they are invaluable for disaster recovery and backups, snapshots tied to volumes that are no longer attached to any EC2 instance serve no practical purpose and end up being a cost liability.
# The Solution: Automating Snapshot Cleanup with AWS Lambda
Here's how we can build a serverless solution to handle this:

Step 1: Fetch Snapshots
The Lambda function first retrieves all EBS snapshots owned by your account.

Step 2: Identify Active EC2 Instances
The function then retrieves a list of active EC2 instances in all states (running and stopped). This ensures that even instances that are temporarily halted are considered.

Step 3: Validate Snapshots
For each snapshot: It checks if the snapshot's associated volume exists.
If the volume exists, the function verifies whether it's still attached to any active EC2 instance.

Step 4: Delete Stale Snapshots
If a snapshot is found to be stale - meaning its volume is not associated with any active instance - the Lambda function deletes it.

# Key Benefits:
Cost Savings: Eliminate unnecessary storage costs by removing unused snapshots.
Automation: Hands-free management with scheduled cleanup.
Scalability: Works seamlessly across large environments.
